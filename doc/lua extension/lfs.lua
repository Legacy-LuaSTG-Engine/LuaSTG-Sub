--- Returns a table with the file attributes corresponding to filepath
--- (or nil followed by an error message and a system-dependent error code in case of error).
--- If the second optional argument is given and is a string,
--- then only the value of the named attribute is returned
--- (this use is equivalent to lfs.attributes(filepath)[aname],
--- but the table is not created and only one attribute is retrieved from the O.S.).
--- if a table is passed as the second argument, it is filled with attributes and returned instead of a new table.
--- The attributes are described as follows; attribute mode is a string, all the others are numbers,
--- and the time related attributes use the same time reference of os.time.
